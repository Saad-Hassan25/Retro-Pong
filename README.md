    <h1>Pong Game with SFML</h1>

   <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This repository contains a classic Pong game implemented in C++ using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). The game supports both player versus player and player versus computer modes.</p>

  <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Run the game executable.</li>
        <li>Select the game mode (player versus player or player versus computer).</li>
        <li>Use arrow keys to control the paddle for player 1 (left paddle).</li>
        <li>For player versus player mode, use W/S keys to control the paddle for player 2 (right paddle).</li>
        <li>For player versus computer mode, the computer-controlled paddle will automatically adjust to the ball's movement.</li>
        <li>Hit the ball with the paddle to prevent it from passing.</li>
        <li>Score points by making the ball pass the opponent's paddle.</li>
        <li>The game ends when one player reaches the maximum score or players decide to quit.</li>
